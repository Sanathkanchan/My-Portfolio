## 4. Lead-Score---Case-Study
An X Education need help to select the most promising leads, i.e. the leads that are most likely to convert into paying customers. The company requires us to build a model wherein you need to assign a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with lower lead score have a lower conversion chance. The CEO, in particular, has given a ballpark of the target lead conversion rate to be around 80%. <br>

### Conclusion
It was found that the variables that mattered the most in the potential buyers are (In descending order) :
- The total time spend on the Website.
- Total number of visits.
- Where the lead source was: 
    - Google
    - Direct traffic
    - Organic search

- When the last activity was:
    - SMS
    - Olark chat conversation<br>
